                <p>I am a lifelong Torontonian that is a visual designer. I initially got into design to make things look aesthetic, but I quickly found out that is only one part of a whole. As I learned more, the visuals for a design can have meaning and be an aid for communicating a story. This new outlook I found is what I strive for with each project I am a part of whether it be a digital product or physical product, <span class="hilight">I give intention to what you see.</span> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of design, I am a passionate <span class="hilight"> car enthusiast </span> and love to involve myself with cars as much as I can creatively. In my spare time I love to read up on car history, virtually time attack around a racetrack, illustrate cars, as well as 3D model and render them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am currently studying my 3rd year of Global Business and Digital Arts at the University of Waterloo, pursuing my
                    bachelor's degree.
                    <br>

            <h2>My Beliefs</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>Continuously Learning</h3>
            <br>
            Whether that be picking up new skillsets to add to my toolkit, picking myself back up from failure or getting to be more empathetic to people working in different industries by experiencing their skills for the first time. I believe learning is a lifelong journey that allows us to grow as individuals. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Steady Effciency</h3>
            <br>
            To achieve quality results, I believe it takes time through continuously improving. I keep this mindset in me while working so I stay in the present of what I am doing. To focus on the smaller tasks at hand that will eventually compound into something great.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3> Balance </h3>
            <br>
            Even though I may get too focused on working at times, I still believe that keeping in check other aspect of life such as your health and personal relationships are just as important. If these factors are not maintained, then the longevity of being able to produce work cannot be sustained. </p>
